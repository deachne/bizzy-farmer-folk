# A Year in the Life: Modern Farm Management

## Winter Planning (January-March)

**John sits at his kitchen table** reviewing last season's actual expenses across his 20 fields totaling 5,000 acres. His farm app displays a financial summary showing input costs, operational expenses, and profit margins for each field.

"Show me last year's crop rotation," John asks.

The app displays a color-coded map of all 20 fields with their 2024 crops. John knows he needs to plan the upcoming rotation carefully.

"Let's start my 2025 crop plan based on rotation needs and soil tests," he tells the app.

Rather than navigating through complex menus, the app begins building a comprehensive crop plan, integrating:
- Projected crop prices pulled from current market data
- Projected expenses based on historical patterns and current quotes
- Soil test results for each field
- Rotation requirements and field history

John selects different nutrient calculation formulas for different management approaches:
"Use regenerative formula for Fields 3-7, and standard Manitoba formula for the rest."

The app calculates total fertilizer requirements for the entire farm operation, breaking it down by individual nutrients (N, P, K, S, micronutrients) and by field.

"Generate fertilizer quote requests based on these requirements," John requests.

The app creates detailed quote specifications that John can send to multiple retailers, ensuring he can compare pricing on identical blends and products.

John spends his evenings researching new growing techniques. When he watches educational YouTube videos, he can easily capture key insights with a voice command: "Note this 15-minute mark about humic acid application timing for the wheat fields."

While reviewing machinery maintenance needs, John says, "Create maintenance task lists for the combine, tractor, and air seeder." The app builds comprehensive maintenance schedules, parts lists, and task assignments that can be shared with his farm team.

As winter progresses, John logs daily observations: "It's -51 today, possibility of winterkill in exposed areas," or "Heavy fog this morning, third day in a row." The app tags these with weather data and creates alerts for potential field impacts.

Other observations like "Fox running across back trees again this morning" might seem trivial but could signal wildlife patterns important for future reference.

When reviewing field boundaries, John tags: "Field 12 needs stone picking before seeding" and "Check drainage in Field 7's northwest corner during spring melt." These georeferenced notes will automatically resurface when planning spring operations for those fields.

## Spring Preparation & Seeding (April-May)

As snow melts, John drives his property making observations: "Field 4 has significant standing water in the east section. Tag this area for drainage planning." The app geotags this observation and adds it to a drainage planning category.

Using soil moisture readings, John asks the app: "What's the optimal seeding order based on soil conditions?" The app analyzes soil temperature data, drainage patterns, and historical field readiness to suggest an optimal seeding sequence.

A crucial planning task is optimizing the air seeder tank configurations. John says, "Optimize my air seeder tanks based on fertilizer blend requirements."

The app analyzes:
- Air seeder tank sizes (both dry and liquid)
- Required nutrients per field
- Travel distances and refill logistics
- Field sizes and configurations

It then suggests optimal blends and tank configurations to maximize acres per fill, reducing downtime and improving efficiency.

"For Fields 3-9, place the 46-0-0 in tank 1, the 11-52-0 in tank 2, and the micronutrient blend in tank 3. This will allow 160 acres per fill with your current application rates."

Before seeding, John imports his Climate FieldView fertility zones into the app, creating variable rate prescriptions that align with his soil test results and crop plans.

"Setup field trials for testing humic acid efficacy," John requests. The app helps design strip trials across multiple fields, documenting control areas and treatment zones, ensuring these will be tracked throughout the season.

## Growing Season (June-August)

As crops emerge, John begins his systematic scouting program. Rather than separate apps or paper notes, he captures everything in one place:

"Scouting Field 6 today. Emergence is 85%, first leaf stage. Some cutworm damage in sandy areas." The app tags this to the specific field, adds the growth stage information, and flags the pest observation for monitoring.

During critical growth stages, John collects soil samples to test for biological activity, electrical conductivity, and compaction. "Submit soil samples for Fields 7, 12, and 15 for biological analysis," he tells the app, which generates sample submission forms and tracking IDs.

Tissue testing is a crucial part of his program: "Taking tissue samples at flag leaf stage for wheat in Fields 3, 8, and 10." Later, when results arrive, John forwards them to the app, which automatically extracts the data and correlates it with previous soil tests, application rates, and growth observations.

During each scouting trip, John assesses weed pressure, diseases, and insect activity. "Field 9 showing 30% wild oats in the northern section and early signs of sclerotinia in low areas." These observations help build treatment recommendations and timing.

Near harvest, John does yield estimations: "Field 3 wheat is estimating 62 bushels per acre, down from 70 due to the dry August."

## Harvest & Post-Harvest (September-November)

As harvest begins, detailed tracking becomes crucial. Climate FieldView collects yield data automatically, but John supplements this with quality observations: "Field 7 wheat protein testing at 14.2%, moisture at 13.5%."

For trial areas, John pays special attention: "Humic acid trial in Field 4 showing 7 bushel advantage over control strips."

As grain comes off the field, John tracks bin allocations: "Bin 7 now has 11,250 bushels of wheat from Fields 3 and 4, average protein 13.8%." The app maintains a comprehensive inventory, vital for marketing decisions.

When truckers arrive to move grain, John generates bills of lading directly from the app: "Create BOL for 42,000 pounds of canola from Bin 12 to Richardson's in Yorkton." This maintains a clean chain of custody and simplifies accounting.

Throughout the year, his grain marketing activities are tracked: "Sold 30,000 bushels of wheat at $8.50 for January delivery." The app integrates these contracts with inventory, flagging when delivery commitments approach.

Post-harvest soil sampling becomes a priority: "Scheduling soil tests for all 20 fields using the comprehensive package." Results are automatically integrated into the system for next year's planning.

During equipment winterizing, John creates tasks: "Clean combine sieves, change hydraulic filters, and store in shed 2." The app adds these to the maintenance tracking system, ensuring nothing is overlooked.

## Year-End Analysis (December)

The power of the system becomes most apparent at year-end, when John can analyze comprehensive data across his entire operation:

"Show me ROI comparison by field, crop type, and input program."

The app generates a detailed analysis showing:
- Which fields performed best financially
- How different input strategies affected the bottom line
- How trials performed compared to standard practices
- Weather impact on various crops and fields

"What were the key yield-limiting factors this season?" John asks.

The app analyzes all collected data—soil tests, tissue tests, weather patterns, scouting notes, and yield results—to identify patterns:
- "Sulfur deficiency appeared to limit canola yields in Fields 8, 12, and 15"
- "Wheat yields showed strong correlation with early season rainfall and biological activity scores"
- "Fields with humic acid application showed 8% average yield increase across all crops"

These insights drive planning for the coming season, completing the cycle as John begins thinking about next year's crop plan.
