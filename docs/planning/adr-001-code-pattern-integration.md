# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## ADR-001: Code Pattern Integration Approach

Date: 2024-03-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to build the BizzyPerson Knowledge Management System by leveraging capabilities from two existing open-source projects:
- AnythingLLM: Excellent document processing and knowledge management
- LibreChat: Advanced chat interface and LLM integration

We have several possible approaches:
1. Fork and merge both codebases
2. Use them as dependencies/submodules
3. Selectively adapt code patterns and implement our own solution
4. Start completely from scratch

Key constraints:
- Need to build a cohesive product with consistent architecture
- Need flexibility to create a domain-specific extension system
- Need to prioritize core PKM functionality first before agricultural extensions
- The tech stack decisions (React, TypeScript, Fastify, Prisma, Supabase, LanceDB) need to be maintained

## Decision

We will use **Option 3: Selectively adapt code patterns** from both AnythingLLM and LibreChat to implement our own solution. 

Rather than directly merging codebases or using them as dependencies, we will:
1. Study the implementation of key features in both projects
2. Extract core patterns, algorithms, and approaches
3. Implement similar functionality in our own codebase using our chosen tech stack
4. Maintain clean separation between core PKM functionality and agricultural extensions

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Maintains architectural consistency throughout the codebase
- Gives us complete control over the implementation
- Allows us to prioritize features according to our roadmap
- Enables us to design a clean extension system from the start
- Avoids inheriting technical debt from existing projects
- Makes it easier to implement our specific tech stack decisions

### Negative Consequences

- Requires more upfront development effort than directly leveraging existing code
- May take longer to reach feature parity with AnythingLLM and LibreChat
- Increases the risk of reimplementation bugs
- Requires deeper understanding of the original codebases

### Neutral Consequences

- Need to maintain documentation mapping our components to their inspirations
- Regular review of both projects for improvements and features we might adapt

## Implementation Notes

When adapting code patterns:

1. **Document the source**: Include comments referencing where the pattern originated
   ```ts
   /**
    * Document chunking strategy based on AnythingLLM's approach
    * @see https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/server/utils/chunkDocument.js
    */
   ```

2. **Adapt to our stack**: Ensure the implementation aligns with our chosen technologies
   ```ts
   // Original might use MongoDB, adapt to use Prisma + Supabase
   ```

3. **Simplify where possible**: Start with simpler versions of complex features, with hooks for future enhancement
   ```ts
   // TODO: Future enhancement - Add support for custom chunking strategies
   ```

4. **Create clear interfaces**: Design clean APIs between components to allow for future replacement
