- [ ] Port over existing MCP servers
- [ ] Implement tool registration system

## Day 5: BizzyFarmer Extension & Integration

### Morning: BizzyFarmer Extension
- [ ] Port over BizzyFarmer extension
- [ ] Implement agricultural-specific components
- [ ] Create field management system
- [ ] Set up crop tracking features

### Afternoon: Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Implement end-to-end testing

- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Document codebase and APIs

## Day 6: Advanced Features & Polish

### Morning: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement offline capabilities
- [ ] Add mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Create data export/import functionality
- [ ] Set up user management system

### Afternoon: UI Polish
- [ ] Refine UI components
- [ ] Implement animations and transitions
- [ ] Create loading states and error handling
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance

## Day 7: Deployment & Documentation

### Morning: Deployment
- [ ] Create Docker configuration
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement environment configuration
- [ ] Prepare for production deployment

### Afternoon: Documentation
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Write developer guides
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Prepare demo and presentation

## Key Technical Decisions

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite (for faster development)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand (lightweight alternative to Redux)
- **Data Fetching**: React Query (for caching and synchronization)

### Backend
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Vector Database**: LanceDB
- **Relational Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Document Processing**: Custom pipeline inspired by AnythingLLM
- **Chat Processing**: Streaming implementation inspired by LibreChat
- **Extension System**: Custom plugin architecture

### Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Configuration**: Environment variables with validation
- **Persistence**: Supabase for production

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Time Constraints**:
   - Focus on core functionality first
   - Use existing UI components where possible
   - Leverage libraries instead of building from scratch

2. **Technical Complexity**:
   - Simplify architecture where possible
   - Use proven patterns from AnythingLLM and LibreChat
   - Create clear interfaces between components

3. **Feature Parity**:
   - Prioritize must-have features
   - Document nice-to-have features for future implementation
   - Focus on quality over quantity

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if it achieves:

1. A working knowledge management system with document processing
2. A functional chat interface with multi-modal capabilities
3. An extension system that supports the BizzyFarmer module
4. A cohesive user experience across all features
5. A maintainable codebase that can be extended in the future
