# Custom App Approach: BizzyPerson

This repository contains documentation and resources for building a custom app that combines the best features of AnythingLLM and LibreChat into a unified platform for agricultural knowledge management.

## Overview

Instead of continuing with the current orchestration approach that integrates AnythingLLM and LibreChat as separate systems, this project proposes building a custom app that incorporates the key features of both systems into a single, cohesive platform. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Simplified Architecture**: Eliminates the complexity of orchestrating two separate codebases
- **Improved Performance**: Removes the overhead of API calls between services
- **Easier Maintenance**: A single codebase is easier to update and maintain
- **Better User Experience**: Provides a more cohesive integration of features
- **Domain-Specific Optimization**: Specifically optimized for agricultural use cases

## Documentation

This repository includes the following documentation:

1. [**Feasibility Assessment**](custom-app-feasibility-assessment.md) - Analysis of the feasibility of building a custom app in a week
2. [**Implementation Plan**](custom-app-implementation-plan.md) - Detailed day-by-day plan for implementing the custom app
3. [**Architecture**](custom-app-architecture.md) - Technical architecture and system design
4. [**Feature Comparison**](custom-app-feature-comparison.md) - Comparison of features between AnythingLLM, LibreChat, and the custom app
5. [**Starter Template**](custom-app-starter-template.md) - Project structure, configuration files, and starter code

## Key Features

The custom app will preserve and enhance the key features from both AnythingLLM and LibreChat:

### From AnythingLLM:
- Document processing and vectorization
- Knowledge base management
- Retrieval-augmented generation
- Workspaces and document collections

### From LibreChat:
- Advanced multi-modal conversation
- Artifact generation and viewing
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) capabilities
- Extension framework

### New Features:
- Agricultural-specific document processing
- Field management and crop tracking
- Offline capabilities for field use
- Mobile-optimized interface
- Enhanced integration between knowledge base and chat

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a feature-based approach, organizing the codebase around key functional areas rather than technical layers. This makes it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the system.

### Core Components:

1. **Knowledge Base System** - Handles document processing, storage, and retrieval
2. **Chat System** - Manages conversations, LLM interactions, and multi-modal processing
3. **Extension Framework** - Enables the system to be extended with domain-specific functionality
4. **MCP Integration** - Provides specialized tools and resources through the Model Context Protocol

### Technical Stack:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand or Jotai
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB (embedded)
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API, Anthropic API, local models
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Getting Started

To start implementing the custom app:

1. Review the [Feasibility Assessment](custom-app-feasibility-assessment.md) to understand the approach
2. Follow the [Implementation Plan](custom-app-implementation-plan.md) for a day-by-day guide
3. Use the [Starter Template](custom-app-starter-template.md) to bootstrap the project
4. Refer to the [Architecture](custom-app-architecture.md) document for system design guidance
5. Check the [Feature Comparison](custom-app-feature-comparison.md) to understand what features to implement

## Next Steps

1. Set up the basic project structure using the starter template
2. Implement the core knowledge base system
3. Add the chat interface with streaming support
4. Create the extension framework
5. Implement the BizzyFarmer extension
6. Add authentication and user management
7. Set up the document processing pipeline
8. Implement the MCP integration

## Conclusion

Building a custom app that combines the best features of AnythingLLM and LibreChat is an ambitious but achievable goal. By focusing on core functionality first and then adding more advanced features incrementally, it's possible to create a powerful, unified platform for agricultural knowledge management within a week.

The biggest advantage of this approach is eliminating the integration complexity that's currently causing uncertainty about whether the app can "actually come together and make a working app." A fresh start with a clear architecture will provide more confidence in the project's viability and create a solid foundation for future development.
