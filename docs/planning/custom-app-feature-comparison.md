## Key Advantages of the Custom App

1. **Unified Experience**: Instead of switching between two systems, users get a single, cohesive interface that combines the best of both worlds.

2. **Simplified Architecture**: By eliminating the need for API calls between separate systems, the custom app offers better performance and reliability.

3. **Enhanced Integration**: Features from both systems are not just preserved but integrated in ways that enhance their functionality.

4. **Domain-Specific Optimization**: The custom app is specifically optimized for agricultural use cases through the BizzyFarmer extension.

5. **Mobile & Field Optimization**: Unlike the original systems, the custom app is designed from the ground up for use in field environments with limited connectivity.

6. **Streamlined Maintenance**: A single codebase is easier to maintain and update than two separate systems with complex integration points.

7. **Performance Improvements**: By eliminating redundant processing and optimizing data flow, the custom app offers better performance.

8. **Extensibility**: The enhanced extension framework makes it easier to add new features and integrations in the future.
