# BizzyPerson Extension Registration System

## Overview

The BizzyPerson Extension Registration System provides a robust and flexible way to register extensions, manage their lifecycle, and track their capabilities. This system is built on an event-driven architecture that allows the platform to react to extension registration, initialization, and error events.

## Architecture

The extension registration system consists of two main components:

1. **Extension Registry**: A centralized registry that manages extension registration and initialization
2. **Extension API**: A public API that provides easy-to-use functions for extension developers

The system is built on the following key principles:

- **Event-Driven**: The registry emits events for all major lifecycle changes
- **Dependency Management**: Extensions can declare dependencies on other extensions
- **Capability Discovery**: Extensions can provide various capabilities that can be discovered by the platform
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript definitions are provided for a better developer experience

## Extension Registration Process

The extension registration process follows these steps:

1. **Validation**: The extension is validated to ensure it has the required fields
2. **Event Emission**: A `before-register` event is emitted
3. **Hook Registration**: Extension hooks are registered with the system
4. **Capability Registration**: Extension capabilities are registered
5. **State Update**: The extension state is updated to `registered`
6. **Event Emission**: A `registered` event is emitted

### Extension States

Throughout its lifecycle, an extension can be in one of these states:

- **Registered**: The extension is registered but not yet initialized
- **Initializing**: The extension is in the process of being initialized
- **Initialized**: The extension is fully initialized and ready for use
- **Error**: An error occurred during registration or initialization

## Extension Capabilities

Extensions can provide various capabilities:

1. **Document Processors**: Extensions that process and enhance documents
2. **Chat Tools**: Extensions that provide chat functionality
3. **UI Components**: Extensions that provide user interface components
4. **Data Models**: Extensions that provide data models and schemas
5. **AnythingLLM Integrations**: Extensions that integrate with AnythingLLM
6. **LibreChat Integrations**: Extensions that integrate with LibreChat

These capabilities can be discovered and used by the platform through the registry's capability discovery functions.

## Extension Hooks

Extensions can register various hooks to integrate with different parts of the system:

1. **Document Processing Hook**: Allows extensions to process documents
2. **Chat Hook**: Allows extensions to integrate with the chat system
3. **UI Hook**: Allows extensions to provide UI components
4. **AnythingLLM Hook**: Allows extensions to integrate with AnythingLLM
5. **LibreChat Hook**: Allows extensions to integrate with LibreChat

These hooks are registered during the extension registration process and can be invoked by the platform as needed.

## Events

The extension registry emits the following events:

- **extension:before-register**: Emitted before an extension is registered
- **extension:registered**: Emitted after an extension is successfully registered
- **extension:replace**: Emitted when an extension replaces an existing one
- **extension:before-unregister**: Emitted before an extension is unregistered
- **extension:unregistered**: Emitted after an extension is successfully unregistered
- **extension:before-initialize**: Emitted before an extension is initialized
- **extension:initialized**: Emitted after an extension is successfully initialized
- **extension:error**: Emitted when an error occurs during registration or initialization

These events can be used to trigger additional actions or to monitor the extension lifecycle.

## Extension API

The Extension API provides a simplified interface for extension developers:

```javascript
const {
  register,                  // Register an extension
  getExtension,              // Get an extension by name
  getAllExtensions,          // Get all registered extensions
  hasExtension,              // Check if an extension is registered
  unregister,                // Unregister an extension
  getExtensionsByCapability, // Get all extensions with a specific capability
  getCapability,             // Get a specific capability from an extension
  registry                   // Access to the underlying registry
} = require('@bizzy/extension-api');
```

## TypeScript Support

The extension API includes TypeScript definitions to provide type safety and better developer experience:

```typescript
import { Extension, DocumentProcessingContext } from '@bizzy/extension-api';

// Define an extension
const myExtension: Extension = {
  name: 'my-extension',
  version: '1.0.0',
  description: 'My extension description',
  
  // Initialize document processing
  initializeDocumentProcessing: () => {
    return {
      process: async (document: DocumentProcessingContext) => {
        // Process document
        return {
          text: document.text,
          metadata: {
            ...document.metadata,
            processed: true
          }
        };
      }
    };
  }
};

// Register the extension
register(myExtension);
```

## Usage Examples

### Registering an Extension

```javascript
const { register } = require('@bizzy/extension-api');

register({
  name: 'my-extension',
  version: '1.0.0',
  description: 'My extension description',
  
  initializeDocumentProcessing: () => {
    return {
      process: async (document) => {
        // Process document
        return {
          text: document.text,
          metadata: {
            ...document.metadata,
            processed: true
          }
        };
      }
    };
  }
});
```

### Listening for Extension Events

```javascript
const { registry } = require('@bizzy/extension-api');

registry.on('extension:registered', (name, extension) => {
  console.log(`Extension registered: ${name} v${extension.version}`);
});

registry.on('extension:initialized', (name, extension) => {
  console.log(`Extension initialized: ${name} v${extension.version}`);
});

registry.on('extension:error', (name, error) => {
  console.error(`Extension error: ${name} - ${error.message}`);
});
```

### Getting Extensions by Capability

```javascript
const { getExtensionsByCapability } = require('@bizzy/extension-api');

// Get all extensions that provide document processors
const documentProcessorExtensions = getExtensionsByCapability('documentProcessors');

// Process a document with all document processors
async function processDocument(document) {
  let processedDocument = document;
  
  for (const extension of documentProcessorExtensions) {
    const capability = getCapability(extension.name, 'documentProcessors');
    
    if (capability && capability.process) {
      processedDocument = await capability.process(processedDocument);
    }
  }
  
  return processedDocument;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for your extensions to get type safety and better developer experience
2. **Declare Dependencies**: Always declare dependencies on other extensions to ensure proper initialization order
3. **Handle Errors**: Always handle errors in your extension's initialization and hooks
4. **Use Events**: Listen for events to know when extensions are registered and initialized
5. **Provide Capabilities**: Always provide capabilities that can be discovered by the platform
6. **Document Your Extension**: Always provide a clear description and documentation for your extension

## Implementation Details

### Extension Registry

The Extension Registry is implemented as an EventEmitter that manages the extension lifecycle:

```javascript
class ExtensionRegistry extends EventEmitter {
  constructor() {
    super();
    
    // Store extensions by name
    this.extensions = new Map();
    
    // Store capabilities
    this.capabilities = {
      documentProcessors: new Map(),
      chatTools: new Map(),
      uiComponents: new Map(),
      dataModels: new Map(),
      anythingLLMIntegrations: new Map(),
      libreChatIntegrations: new Map()
    };
    
    // Store extension hooks
    this.hooks = new Map();
    
    // Extension states
    this.states = new Map();
    
    // Track extension dependencies
    this.dependencies = new Map();
  }
  
  // Registry methods...
}
```

### Extension API

The Extension API provides a simplified interface for extension developers:

```javascript
// Import the extension API hooks and registry
const hooks = require('./hooks');
const registry = require('./registry');

// Re-export everything from hooks
module.exports = hooks;
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Extension not registered**: Make sure the extension has a valid name and version
2. **Extension not initialized**: Check for errors during initialization
3. **Extension dependency not found**: Make sure all dependencies are registered
4. **Extension capability not available**: Make sure the extension properly registers its capabilities
5. **Type errors**: Make sure you're using the correct types for your extension

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the extension registration system:

1. **Extension Marketplace**: A marketplace for discovering and installing extensions
2. **Extension Versioning**: Better support for extension versioning and upgrading
3. **Extension Configuration**: A system for configuring extensions
4. **Extension Permissions**: A system for managing extension permissions
5. **Extension Testing**: Tools for testing extensions
