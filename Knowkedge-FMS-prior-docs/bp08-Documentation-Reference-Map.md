# BizzyPerson Documentation Reference Map (BP08)

## Purpose

This document serves as a reference map between our structured, numbered documentation files in the `bizzy/docs` directory and the original markdown files in the project root. It ensures that all important information from the original planning documents is properly incorporated into our structured documentation system.

## Key Information Verification

### Core Platform Documentation

- **System Overview (BP01)**: Incorporates architecture diagrams from `farm-llm-architecture.md` and component descriptions from `0000-AnythingLLM-LibreChat-Reference.md`
- **Integration Architecture (BP02)**: Includes integration points from `farm-app-anythingllm-integration.md` and `001.1Librechat-updates.md`
- **Project Roadmap (BP03)**: Based on implementation timeline from `farm-app-project-roadmap.md`
- **Extension API (BP04)**: Incorporates extension mechanisms from `farm-app-mcp-server-design.md`
- **MCP Tools (BP05)**: Includes tool specifications from `farm-app-mcp-server-design.md` and `mcp-clients-analysis.md`
- **UI Components (BP06)**: Based on UI architecture from `Dynamic UI Templates Explained.md` and mobile concepts from `09-mobile-views-ideas.md`
- **Efficient RAG Architecture (BP07)**: Incorporates RAG improvements from `001.2-suggestions-rag-improvement.md` and vectorization strategies from `anythingllm-vectorization-analysis.md`

- **Multi-Modal Integration (BP-INT-07)**: Outlines the strategy for integrating LibreChat's multi-modal capabilities into AnythingLLM
- **Knowledge Base Integration (BP-INT-04)**: Describes the integration of knowledge base capabilities between systems

### BizzyFarmer Extension Documentation

- **Agricultural Knowledge Base (BF01)**: Incorporates farming practices from `001-articles.md` and mission statements from `C-farm-app-mission.md`
- **Field Management (BF02)**: Based on farming operations described in `C-current-farm-operations.md`
- **Mobile Field Tools (BF03)**: Incorporates mobile concepts from `09-mobile-views-ideas.md`
- **Weather Integration (BF04)**: References weather data integration concepts from various source files
- **Equipment Management (BF05)**: Based on equipment tracking needs mentioned in source files

## Missing Information

The following information from original files should be incorporated into our numbered documentation:

1. Detailed agricultural data models from `C-current-farm-operations.md` should be added to `bf02-Field-Management.md`
2. Mobile observation workflow from `09-mobile-views-ideas.md` should be expanded in `bf03-Mobile-Field-Tools.md`
3. Weather integration details should be formalized in `bf04-Weather-Integration.md`
4. Equipment management specifications should be added to `bf05-Equipment-Management.md`
5. Multi-modal field data capture workflows should be added to `bp-int--multi-modal-integration.md`

## Next Steps

1. Review each numbered documentation file against its source material to ensure completeness
2. Add missing information identified above to the appropriate numbered files
3. Update this reference map as new documentation is created
4. Ensure all team members reference the numbered documentation as the authoritative source
