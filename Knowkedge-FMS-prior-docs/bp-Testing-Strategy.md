# BP06: Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the BizzyPerson project, with a focus on ensuring the reliability and correctness of the integration between AnythingLLM and LibreChat.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. For the BizzyPerson project, we use Jest as our primary unit testing framework.

- **Location**: Each module has its own test files, typically named `*.test.js`
- **Coverage**: We aim for at least 80% code coverage for unit tests
- **Running**: Unit tests can be run using `npm test` in each module directory

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly. These tests are particularly important for the BizzyPerson project due to the integration between AnythingLLM and LibreChat.

- **Location**: Integration tests are located in the `tests/integration` directory
- **Coverage**: We focus on testing key integration points between systems
- **Running**: Integration tests can be run using `npm run test:integration`

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests verify that the entire system works correctly from a user's perspective. We use Cypress for end-to-end testing.

- **Location**: End-to-end tests are located in the `tests/e2e` directory
- **Coverage**: We focus on testing key user flows
- **Running**: End-to-end tests can be run using `npm run test:e2e`

## Testing the Unified Authentication System

The unified authentication system is a critical component of the BizzyPerson project, as it provides a seamless authentication experience across both AnythingLLM and LibreChat.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests for the unified authentication system are located in the `bizzy/core/auth` directory. These tests verify that each component of the authentication system works correctly in isolation.

- **Service Tests**: Test the authentication service functions (login, registration, token verification, etc.)
- **Middleware Tests**: Test the authentication middleware functions (token validation, role checking, etc.)
- **Controller Tests**: Test the authentication controller functions (request handling, response formatting, etc.)

### Integration Tests

Integration tests for the unified authentication system verify that it works correctly with both AnythingLLM and LibreChat. These tests are located in the `tests/integration/auth` directory.

- **AnythingLLM Integration**: Test that the authentication system works correctly with AnythingLLM
- **LibreChat Integration**: Test that the authentication system works correctly with LibreChat
- **Cross-System Authentication**: Test that a user authenticated in one system can access resources in the other system

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests for the unified authentication system verify that users can authenticate and access resources across both systems. These tests are located in the `tests/e2e/auth` directory.

- **Login Flow**: Test that users can log in and access resources
- **Registration Flow**: Test that users can register and access resources
- **Two-Factor Authentication Flow**: Test that users with 2FA enabled can authenticate
- **Token Refresh Flow**: Test that tokens can be refreshed when they expire

## Running Tests

### Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests for the unified authentication system:

```bash
cd bizzy/core/auth
./run-tests.sh
```

Or using npm:

```bash
cd bizzy/core/auth
npm test
```

### Running Integration Tests

To run integration tests for the unified authentication system:

```bash
cd bizzy
npm run test:integration -- --testPathPattern=auth
```

### Running End-to-End Tests

To run end-to-end tests for the unified authentication system:

```bash
cd bizzy
npm run test:e2e -- --spec="auth/**/*"
```

## Continuous Integration

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline runs all tests on every pull request and push to the main branch.

- **Unit Tests**: Run on every pull request and push
- **Integration Tests**: Run on every pull request and push
- **End-to-End Tests**: Run on every push to the main branch

## Test Coverage

We use Jest's built-in coverage reporting to track test coverage. Coverage reports are generated when running tests with the `--coverage` flag.

To generate a coverage report for the unified authentication system:

```bash
cd bizzy/core/auth
npm run test:coverage
```

The coverage report will be available in the `bizzy/core/auth/coverage` directory.

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Write tests first**: Follow a test-driven development approach when possible
2. **Keep tests simple**: Each test should test one thing
3. **Use descriptive test names**: Test names should describe what the test is testing
4. **Use mocks and stubs**: Use mocks and stubs to isolate the code being tested
5. **Test edge cases**: Test edge cases and error conditions
6. **Keep tests independent**: Tests should not depend on each other
7. **Test both positive and negative cases**: Test both valid and invalid inputs
8. **Use CI**: Run tests automatically on every pull request and push

## Testing Schedule

- **During development**: Run unit tests continuously during development
- **Before integration**: Run integration tests before integrating new features
- **Before release**: Run all tests before releasing a new version
- **After deployment**: Run end-to-end tests after deploying to production

## Conclusion

Testing is a critical part of the BizzyPerson project. By following this testing strategy, we can ensure that the integration between AnythingLLM and LibreChat is reliable and correct.
