✅ Added connection testing capability for integration settings with visual feedback

✅ Integrated with navigation system and admin dashboard

## Implementation Details

The Configuration Management Interface provides administrators with a centralized, user-friendly interface for managing all system settings and configurations within the BizzyPerson platform.

### Key Components

- **ConfigurationManagement**: Main container component
- **ConfigCategoryPanel**: Renders settings for a specific category
- **SettingField**: Renders appropriate input controls based on setting type

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface ConfigSetting {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  value: string | number | boolean;
  type: 'text' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'select' | 'password';
  options?: string[]; // For select type
  category: 'system' | 'security' | 'integration' | 'notification' | 'performance';
  isSecret?: boolean;
  validation?: {
    required?: boolean;
    min?: number;
    max?: number;
    pattern?: string;
  };
}

interface ConfigCategory {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon: ReactNode;
  settings: ConfigSetting[];
}
```

### Features Implemented

1. **Categorized Settings**: Settings organized into logical categories with tab-based navigation
2. **Search and Filtering**: Real-time search across all settings with results displayed in their categories
3. **Edit Mode**: Toggle between view and edit modes for controlled modifications
4. **Setting Types**: Support for text, number, boolean, select, and password fields
5. **Validation**: Field-level validation with constraints like required, min/max, and patterns
6. **Import/Export**: Import and export functionality for configuration backup and migration
7. **Integration Testing**: Test connections for integration settings with visual feedback
8. **Security**: Proper handling of sensitive information with password masking

### UI/UX Considerations

- Consistent with BizzyPerson's blue-themed admin interface
- Clear visual hierarchy with categorized settings
- Responsive design that works well on different screen sizes
- Visual indicators for required fields and validation states
- Information architecture that makes settings easy to find and understand

## Documentation

- Full component documentation created at `bizzy/docs/bp-admin--configuration-management.md`
- Project checklists updated in both `bp00-Project-Checklist.md` and `bp04-Project-Checklist.md`

## Next Steps

- Consider adding configuration version history and rollback capabilities
- Implement user-specific setting overrides
- Add environment-specific configurations (development, staging, production)
- Create visual diff tool for comparing configurations
- Add setting change auditing and approval workflows
