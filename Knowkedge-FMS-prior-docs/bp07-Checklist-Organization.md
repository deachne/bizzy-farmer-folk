# BizzyPerson Checklist Organization (BP07)

## Overview

This document explains the organization of the BizzyPerson project checklists and how they are used to track progress.

## Checklist Structure

BizzyPerson uses two complementary checklists:

1. **Master Checklist (`bp00-Project-Checklist.md`)**
   - Comprehensive project plan with detailed phases and timelines
   - Contains implementation notes for completed items
   - Organized by project phases (1-4)
   - Includes detailed progress tracking

2. **Implementation Checklist (`bp04-Project-Checklist.md`)**
   - Simplified, actionable checklist focused on implementation status
   - Organized by project phases and components
   - Used for day-to-day tracking of development progress

## Task ID System

Both checklists use a consistent task ID system to enable cross-referencing:

```
[BP-CORE-01] Create project directory structure
```

Where:
- `BP` indicates BizzyPerson project
- `CORE` indicates the component (CORE, INT, EXT, BF, etc.)
- `01` is a sequential number within that component

## Component Prefixes

The following prefixes are used for different components:

- `CORE`: Core Platform Setup
- `INT`: Integration Layer
- `EXT`: Extension Framework
- `TOOL`: Tool Framework
- `MCP`: MCP Integration
- `ART`: Artifact System
- `DATA`: Data Model Framework
- `UI`: UI Extension System
- `BF`: BizzyFarmer Extension
- `TEST`: Testing and Deployment
- `DOC`: Documentation
- `FUT`: Future Enhancements

## Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked in both checklists:

1. **Master Checklist**: Includes a detailed progress tracking table with status, percentage, and notes for each component.

2. **Implementation Checklist**: Includes a simplified progress tracking table with status and percentage for each component.

## Updating Checklists

When updating the checklists:

1. **Adding New Tasks**:
   - Add the task to both checklists with the same task ID
   - Include detailed implementation notes in the Master Checklist
   - Keep the Implementation Checklist entry concise

2. **Completing Tasks**:
   - Mark the task as complete in both checklists
   - Add implementation notes to the Master Checklist
   - Update the progress tracking tables in both checklists

3. **Changing Task Scope**:
   - Update both checklists to reflect the new scope
   - Adjust task IDs if necessary
   - Update progress tracking accordingly

## Using Task IDs in Code

Task IDs should be used in:

1. **Commit Messages**:
   ```
   git commit -m "[BP-CORE-01] Create project directory structure"
   ```

2. **Code Comments**:
   ```javascript
   // [BP-CORE-01] Project directory structure
   function createDirectoryStructure() {
     // ...
   }
   ```

3. **Documentation**:
   ```markdown
   ## Project Structure
   
   This section describes the project structure ([BP-CORE-01]).
   ```

## Checklist Review Process

1. **Weekly Review**:
   - Review both checklists weekly
   - Update completion status
   - Add new tasks as needed

2. **Milestone Review**:
   - Conduct a thorough review at each milestone
   - Update implementation notes
   - Adjust timelines and dependencies

3. **Phase Transition**:
   - Review and update both checklists when moving to a new phase
   - Archive completed phases if needed
   - Focus on current and upcoming tasks
