## Relationships

The data models are related in the following ways:

1. A **Field** can have one current **Crop** and many historical **Crops**
2. A **Field** can have many **Soil Tests**
3. A **Field** can have many **Harvest Records**
4. **Equipment** can be associated with many **Harvest Records**
5. **Weather Data** can be associated with **Fields** based on location
6. A **Crop** can be associated with many **Harvest Records**

## Schema Validation

Each data model includes a JSON schema for validation. These schemas define the required properties, data types, and constraints for each model, ensuring data integrity throughout the system.
