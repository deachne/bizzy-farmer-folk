## Notes and Considerations

- All components should implement both light and dark mode variations
- Components should respect the CSS variables defined in the design system
- Mobile/touch-friendly interactions should be a priority
- All components should have proper loading and error states
- Consider using React.lazy for code splitting of complex components
