# System Monitoring Tools

**Component ID**: BP-ADMIN-04  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Type**: Admin Component  
**Priority**: High  

## Overview

The System Monitoring Tools component provides administrators with comprehensive visibility into the health, performance, and operational status of the BizzyPerson platform. This component enables real-time monitoring, troubleshooting, and management of system resources and services.

## Features

### 1. System Health Dashboard
- Real-time status indicators for overall system health
- Resource usage metrics (CPU, memory, storage) with status indicators
- Service status overview with visual indicators
- Alert counts by severity and status

### 2. Resource Metrics
- Detailed metrics for CPU, memory, storage, and network usage
- Visual indicators for normal, warning, and critical states
- Historical usage trends and current values
- Categorized view of resource metrics by type

### 3. Service Status Management
- Comprehensive list of all platform services with status indicators
- Filtering and search capabilities for services
- Service management actions (restart, stop, start)
- Uptime tracking and last updated timestamps

### 4. Performance Metrics
- Time-series data visualization for system performance
- Configurable time ranges (hour, day, week, month)
- Multiple metric selection for comparative analysis
- Status indicators for performance trends

### 5. Alert Management
- Centralized view of all system alerts
- Filtering by severity, status, and search terms
- Alert acknowledgment and resolution workflows
- Detailed alert information with timestamps and sources

### 6. Log Viewer
- Consolidated log viewing for all system components
- Filtering by log level, source, and search terms
- Detailed log entries with metadata
- Log download capabilities for further analysis

## Technical Implementation

The System Monitoring Tools component follows BizzyPerson's standard component architecture with these specific elements:

### Component Structure
- `SystemMonitoring/` - Main container component
- `SystemMonitoring/ResourceMetricsPanel` - Resource metrics visualization
- `SystemMonitoring/ServiceStatusTable` - Service listing with actions
- `SystemMonitoring/AlertHistoryList` - Alert listing and management
- `SystemMonitoring/PerformanceMetricsChart` - Performance data visualization
- `SystemMonitoring/LogViewer` - Log filtering and display

### Data Model
```typescript
// Key data structures
interface ResourceMetric {
  name: string;
  value: number;
  unit: string;
  max?: number;
  status: 'normal' | 'warning' | 'critical';
}

interface SystemService {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: 'healthy' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'inactive';
  lastUpdated: string | Date;
  uptime?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

interface Alert {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  message: string;
  timestamp: string | Date;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  status: 'active' | 'resolved' | 'acknowledged';
  source: string;
}

interface LogEntry {
  id: string;
  timestamp: string | Date;
  level: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'debug';
  source: string;
  message: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Design Patterns
- Tabs-based navigation for different monitoring views
- Card-based layout for visual separation of concerns
- Status color coding (green, yellow, red) for quick visual scanning
- Filter patterns consistent with other admin components
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Integration

### Dashboard Integration
The System Monitoring Tools component integrates with the main Admin Dashboard through:
- Navigation menu item in the Admin sidebar
- Consistent UI patterns and styling with other admin components
- State management patterns matching existing admin components

### Related Components
- **Dashboard** (BP-ADMIN-01) - Provides main navigation framework
- **User Management** (BP-ADMIN-02) - Shares design patterns and UI components
- **Extension Management** (BP-ADMIN-03) - Shares design patterns and layout approaches

## Usage Guidelines

The System Monitoring Tools component should be used by platform administrators to:

1. Monitor overall system health and performance
2. Identify and troubleshoot issues before they impact users
3. Manage system services and resources
4. Review and respond to system alerts
5. Access and analyze logs for debugging

## API Requirements

Backend APIs needed to support this component:

- `GET /api/admin/monitoring/metrics` - Retrieve resource metrics
- `GET /api/admin/monitoring/services` - Get status of system services
- `GET /api/admin/monitoring/alerts` - Get system alerts
- `GET /api/admin/monitoring/performance` - Get performance metrics
- `GET /api/admin/monitoring/logs` - Get system logs
- `POST /api/admin/monitoring/services/:id/:action` - Perform service actions
- `POST /api/admin/monitoring/alerts/:id/:action` - Perform alert actions
- `GET /api/admin/monitoring/logs/download` - Download logs

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements include:

1. Real-time data updates via WebSockets
2. Custom alert configuration
3. Notification systems for critical alerts
4. Expanded metrics visualization options
5. Historical data analysis and reporting
6. Custom dashboard view with user-selected metrics
7. Integration with external monitoring tools
8. Automated remediation options for common issues
