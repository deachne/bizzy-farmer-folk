# BizzyPerson Unified UI Integration (BP08)

## Overview

This document outlines the approach for integrating AnythingLLM and LibreChat into a unified user interface for BizzyPerson. Rather than maintaining two separate interfaces or creating a completely new UI, we will use AnythingLLM's UI as the primary interface and embed LibreChat's capabilities within it.

## Integration Principles

1. **AnythingLLM as Primary UI**
   - Use AnythingLLM's clean, modern UI design language
   - Maintain its workspace-centric organization
   - Preserve its document management interface

2. **Embedded LibreChat Capabilities**
   - Integrate LibreChat's chat capabilities directly into AnythingLLM's interface
   - Add LibreChat's tool framework as an extension to AnythingLLM's chat
   - Incorporate LibreChat's artifact rendering within AnythingLLM's chat panels
   - Integrate LibreChat's multi-modal capabilities (image, audio, file handling)

3. **Seamless User Experience**
   - Users should not perceive they're using two different systems
   - Consistent styling, interactions, and terminology throughout
   - Single authentication and user management system
