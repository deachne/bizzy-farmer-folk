# BizzyPerson - Next Steps

## Completed Tasks

1. **Project Renaming and Restructuring**
   - Renamed project from "Farm Management System" to "BizzyPerson"
   - Created new directory structure for core-first approach
   - Set up basic project files (README.md, package.json, etc.)

2. **Documentation**
   - Created System Overview document
   - Updated Project Checklist for core-first approach
   - Created Architecture Diagram
   - Set up basic contributing guidelines

## Technical Considerations

1. **Integration Approach**
   - Use composition over inheritance
   - Create clear interfaces between components
   - Implement adapter pattern for integration
   - Use dependency injection for flexibility

2. **Extension API Design**
   - Create stable, versioned API
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Document all extension points
   - Provide example extensions

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Implement unit tests for core components
   - Create integration tests for extension points
   - Develop end-to-end tests for key workflows
   - Set up continuous integration

4. **Deployment Considerations**
   - Design for containerization
   - Create development, staging, and production environments
   - Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Plan for scalability and performance
